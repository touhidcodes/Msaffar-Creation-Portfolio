      "Landscape photography is all about capturing the beauty of the natural world. Start by using a small aperture (f/8 f/16) to ensure everything from the foreground to the horizon is in sharp focus. Use a tripod to avoid blur, especially in low light. The golden hour (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) provides the best lighting. Use leading lines and foreground elements like rocks or trees to add depth. Don't forget to explore different weather conditions fog, clouds, or storms can add drama to your shots.",

      "Portrait photography captures the personality and emotion of your subject. Use a wide aperture (f/1.8 f/2.8) to blur the background and focus attention on the eyes. Shoot during golden hour or in diffused light for flattering skin tones. Guide your subject to relax and express themselves naturally. Position your camera at eye level and use the rule of thirds to enhance composition. Reflectors and soft boxes can help control shadows and highlights.",

Set your camera to manual mode, and start with settings like ISO 800 3200, f/2.8, and a shutter speed of 10 30 seconds. Use manual focus and shoot in RAW for better editing flexibility. Street lights, car trails, and stars can become stunning subjects. Experiment with light painting or capture the Milky Way for a magical effect.",
