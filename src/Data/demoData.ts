      "Landscape photography is all about capturing the beauty of the natural world. Start by using a small aperture (f/8 f/16) to ensure everything from the foreground to the horizon is in sharp focus. Use a tripod to avoid blur, especially in low light. The golden hour (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) provides the best lighting. Use leading lines and foreground elements like rocks or trees to add depth. Don't forget to explore different weather conditions fog, clouds, or storms can add drama to your shots.",

Shoot during golden hour or in diffused light for flattering skin tones. Guide your subject to relax and express themselves naturally. Position your camera at eye level and use the rule of thirds to enhance composition. Reflectors and soft boxes can help control shadows and highlights.",
